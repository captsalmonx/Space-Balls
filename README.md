# Space-Balls
Gravity golf in space with wacky physics.

This is a second year games programming assignment to demonstrate Newtonian physics in the context of a game.
It was built using the Microsoft XNA framework in the space of about 3 or so days.

Level 1 - Space Golf. Putt the golf ball into the black hole using the ship.

Level 2 - Gravity Flip. Using the action button, flip the gravity of every planet to sink the golf ball.

Level 3 - Planet Pinball. Gravity affects bullets, and each planet affects everything else. Rather unpredictable.
